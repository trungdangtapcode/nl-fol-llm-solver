Per Premise 8, if the instructor is absent and no replacement is found within 1 hour (Premise 9), the session is canceled, preventing participation. Bad weather at 8:00 AM (Premise 12) would delay the 9:00 AM flight by at least 2 hours, but cancellation due to the instructor overrides this. Since the session is canceled, Premise 17 requires Lan to take a make-up session within 2 weeks to retain flight exam eligibility, with notification feasible by 8:30 AM (Premise 16)."

Take a student who passes the exam—let’s call them Alex. Since Alex passes, Premise 8 says they study regularly. Premise 2 means that if they didn’t qualify for a scholarship, they wouldn’t study regularly, but since they do study regularly, they must qualify for a scholarship. Then, Premise 10 says that if they didn’t get a recommendation, they wouldn’t qualify, so because they qualify, Alex must have a recommendation letter. This applies to every student who passes, matching option A: every student who passes the exam receives a recommendation letter. Option B is incorrect because only students who study regularly or qualify attend tutoring, not necessarily everyone. Option C is incorrect because while some qualify (Premise 9), nothing confirms others don’t. Option D is incorrect because students who don’t pass may not qualify or get recommendations.",

The given information says that if a student passes the exam, they study regularly (Premise 8), and if a student studies regularly, they attend tutoring sessions (Premise 6). Take a student who passes the exam—say, Jamie. Since Jamie passes, Premise 8 says they study regularly. Because they study regularly, Premise 6 says they attend tutoring sessions.

Together, they imply a biconditional: ∀x (PassedPrerequisite(x) ↔ EligibleToEnroll(x)), confirming that eligibility and passing the prerequisite are equivalent. Thus, option B (‘No student is eligible without passing the prerequisite’) is true, as it restates Premise 4’s implication. Option A is false, as Premise 4 ensures no student can be eligible without passing, contradicting ∃x (EligibleToEnroll(x) ∧ ¬PassedPrerequisite(x)). Option C is false, as Premise 3 (∀x CompletedIntroCourses(x)) means all students, including eligible ones, have completed introductory courses, contradicting EligibleToEnroll(x) → ¬CompletedIntroCourses(x). Option D is false, as Premise 1 states that passing implies eligibility, contradicting PassedPrerequisite(x) → ¬EligibleToEnroll(x).",
            "Premise 2 states there exists at least one eligible student: ∃x EligibleToEnroll(x). Premise 4 states that eligibility requires passing the prerequisite: ∀x (EligibleToEnroll(x) → PassedPrerequisite(x)). For some student s where EligibleToEnroll(s) holds (from Premise 2), Premise 4 implies PassedPrerequisite(s) must also hold. Thus, there exists a student s satisfying both PassedPrerequisite(s) and EligibleToEnroll(s), so ∃x (PassedPrerequisite(x) ∧ EligibleToEnroll(x)) is true, confirming the answer ‘Yes’."

Let’s check a device with a motion sensor—say, device X. Since it has a motion sensor, Premise 1 says it’s compatible with apps. Then, because it’s compatible with apps, Premise 2 says it’s energy efficient. So, any device with a motion sensor ends up being energy efficient, which matches option B: all devices with motion sensors are energy efficient. Option A is incorrect because Premise 2 says all app-compatible devices are energy efficient, so none can be compatible but not energy efficient. Option C is incorrect because a device could be energy efficient without being app-compatible or having a motion sensor—the information doesn’t force energy-efficient devices to have sensors. Option D is incorrect because Premise 3 only says devices without motion sensors aren’t app-compatible, but they could still be energy efficient some other way.",

The given information says that if a device doesn’t have a motion sensor, it’s not compatible with smart home apps (Premise 3). This means that to be compatible with apps, a device must have a motion sensor, because lacking one prevents compatibility. The statement matches this idea: all app-compatible devices need motion sensors. To double-check, Premise 1 says devices with motion sensors are app-compatible, which supports the idea that motion sensors and app compatibility go together. Since Premise 3 confirms no app-compatible device can lack a motion sensor, the statement is true."

This holds for any frequently borrowed book, matching option A: every frequently borrowed book is both well-catalogued and recommended. Option B is incorrect because the information says every book is frequently borrowed (Premise 19), and even if some weren’t, nothing says they’d be well-catalogued. Option C is incorrect because every book is available (Premise 1), so no book can be unavailable and well-catalogued. Option D is incorrect because every book is in good condition (Premise 8), so recommended books are in good condition, not the opposite.",

However, no premise confirms the existence of energy-efficient routes, so ∃x (¬WellMaintained(x) ∧ CostEffective(x)) isn’t guaranteed. Nor do the premises rule it out, as such a route is possible.
